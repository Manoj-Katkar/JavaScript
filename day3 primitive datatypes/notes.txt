null datatype : it is used to de refer the object 

Datatype of the null is = object 

Undefined =  means we have not initialize the variable with the data then we will get undefined 
            datatype of the undefined is undefined means nothing is present in that variable 

not defined = is the error (we can not do the Arithmatic operations betwenn the number and string then it will return NaN s)
            type of NaN is Number
