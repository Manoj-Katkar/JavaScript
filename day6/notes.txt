Types of the functions 
1) Ananymous function : 
        function with no function name is known is Ananymous function 
        we could not able do declare or define the Ananymous function alone 
        and we could not able to call this function also 
    
    example : (Syntax)
       function(){
        //code 
       }


2)NamedFunction : means function with function name 
                 we can call this function with function name 

    example : (Syntax)
       function functionName(){
        //code 
       }

       how to call this function // using function name 



3)Function with Expression : passing the function to the any variable is known as the function with expression 
                            or passing the function as the value to  the one varaible is known as FWE
    
    //How to call the above function
    using the variableName();

    
    example : (Syntax)
       let Ans  = function(){  //
                    //code 
                  }


    calling the function with Expression
    Ans();

                    //==============================================//

4)Arrow Function:   here we declare the function without using the function keyword

    //How to call the above function
    using the variableName();


    example : (Syntax)
       let ar  = (here pass the parameters ) =>{
                    //code
                  }

    calling the function with Expression
    ar();

    example 2 : (Syntax)  (without using the curlly brackets)
    (when I will have the only one line then only use this arrow function where the )

       let add  = (d , e) =>console.log(d + e);   //this is one function 

       add(20 , 30);

       output = 50;


    example 2 : (Syntax)  (without using the parameter in the round bracket )
    (when I will have the only one line then only use this arrow function where the )

       let check  = num =>num>100;   //this is one function 

       check(3000);

       output = true;


5)HOF : Higher order Function
then function which takes the function as an argument is known as HOF

6)call back function 
            the function that we are passing as the parameter is known as the call back function


7)IIFE (Immediate invoke function expression)            
            after defining the function it is immediate  to call the function 
            we can able to call the function only one time 

            Advantage of using IIFE
            1)to avoid the global pollution (means to save the memory space)
            2)once it will get executed it will automatic get removed from the call stack 

        Syntax:
        (define any one type of the Function)(Function call);


Global : create variables with var keyword
Const = if the value is not going to change then declare it using the const 
otherwise create the variables with the let keyword
