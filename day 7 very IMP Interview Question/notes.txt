JS Engine 
    is the execution unit of browser 
    and it is resposible for the code execution only at the browser side 
    each and every browser have differnt JS Engine 
    
    example : 

    Browser            Js Engine
    chrome               V8
    FireFox              SpiderMonkey
    Safari               JS core
    MS Edge              Chakra



    parser = check for the syntax mistake it will return abstract syntax tree is AST 
    AST = it is just the result of the parser  
    interprter : it will check the code line by line 
    JIT = just intime compiler 
    Byte code : it will understand by the Machine only 
    then code execution will done 




Window : 
     it is the supermost object in javascript 
     it refers to the browser window 
     it will have differnt method and properties 
     if we declare the variable using the var then it will also get store in the Window object 

    (IMP) if we want to acess any properties then  we can access with window as prefix  or we can use directlly also only for the window object 
     example = window.alert();


Note : all the methods are the childs of the window  object (prompt() , document() , etc )

this Keyword: 
    if you declare it globally then it will refer to the Window Object 
    so we can access the global scope varaible in the local scope using 
    Syntax : 
            this.globalVariableName
 
//.........................................................//


GEC : (Global Execution Context  we have two phase )
when we create the javascript code then GEC will get created 
            phase 1 = varaible declaration or function declaration phase

            phase 2 = It will initialize the value to the variables  and also checks the function call

            then for the each function calling statement it will create the Function Execution Context and it will also have the 2 phase as similar to the GEC  

call stack : it will give the info about the which function running now  or to track the which functions are getting executed 







//..........................//

Nested Function : function inside the function








//...........................//

Closure(very very IMP Question )
    it is the scope or the memory allocation which gets created when you access the outer function variable inside the inner function

  or whenever we will try to access the outer function variables inside the inner function then the closure will get created for the outer function

variable hosting 
  moving variable declaration to the top is known as varaible hosting
  before the code get execute it will first get load 
  means the taking the varaible declaration to the top 

Note : it will return undefined for the only var variable but for let and const it will throw the error (Uncath referance error)
        because of the (Temporal Dead Zone )   very IMP
        1)means for script scope the value will be unavailable  so you will get error here 
        2)and for the global scope and local scope  varables will be always undefined 



//................................................//

function hosting
      means the taking the function declaration to the top 
      it is only applicabled for the only named function
      it is not compulsory to call the function after declaration you can call before declaration
